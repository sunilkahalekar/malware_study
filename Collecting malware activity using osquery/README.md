Collecting malware activity using osquery can be a complex task, as it requires a thorough understanding of the types of malicious activities that you want to monitor. However, here is a sample osquery configuration file that you could use as a starting point for monitoring malware activity:

This configuration file schedules four queries to run every 60 seconds:

malware_events: This query detects any process activity in the /tmp and /var/tmp directories, which are commonly used by malware to store their executable files.

malware_user_login: This query detects any non-root user logins in the past day, which could indicate a compromised account.

malware_network_activity: This query detects any network connections to non-local addresses, which could indicate communication with a command-and-control server.

malware_file_modification: This query detects any suspicious file modifications outside of system directories, which could indicate attempts to install or modify malware.

Note that this is just a starting point, and you may need to customize the queries to suit your specific needs and environment. Also, keep in mind that osquery should be used as part of a broader security strategy and not as a standalone solution.
