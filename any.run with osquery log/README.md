Comparing Any.Run macro logs with osquery logs for macro malware can be useful in detecting and analyzing macro malware activity. Here are some ways you can compare the two:

Timestamps: Both Any.Run and osquery logs should have timestamps for when the macro malware activity occurred. Comparing the timestamps can help you identify whether the macro malware was executed at the same time on both systems.

Process information: Osquery logs can provide detailed information about the process that executed the macro malware, including the process name, path, command-line, and parent process. Comparing this information with the process information in the Any.Run logs can help you identify whether the same process was used to execute the macro malware on both systems.

Registry changes: Macro malware often makes changes to the system registry. Osquery can monitor registry changes and log them to help you identify whether the macro malware made the same registry changes on both systems.

Network connections: Macro malware may establish network connections to communicate with a command-and-control server. Any.Run logs can show you the network connections made by the macro malware, while osquery logs can provide additional details such as the process that initiated the connection, the destination IP address and port, and the protocol used. Comparing these logs can help you identify whether the same network connections were made on both systems.

By comparing Any.Run macro logs with osquery logs, you can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the macro malware activity and identify patterns and similarities that can help you detect and prevent similar attacks in the future.
