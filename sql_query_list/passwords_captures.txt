This query uses the osquery tables registry, firefox_logins, chrome_logins, safari_autofill, and 
opera_autofill to retrieve the usernames and passwords stored by each browser. It also includes a 
column to indicate which browser the credentials are associated with. Note that this query may 
require elevated privileges to access certain system areas where the password data is stored.
