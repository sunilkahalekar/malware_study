event id defines different event

there could be same guid for multiple pid. pid having multiple guid.
pguid iteslf is suffieint

if you are socket event only ip do not collect socket connet, socket listen that automatically reduce traffic.


what parent is one row what will be another row is wise versa
crome have process guid
crome launch notepad then has prent guid
for crome parent somethin gelse but notepad parent will be chrome.

What is child in one activity that coul dbe prent is another activity.
100 process guid ir 100 prcess are created. that could  be one parent or any no beween 1 and 100.
Looking at 100 process guid come to know that 100 unique process created.

guid will be unique. 50000 notepad are genearted but pid of notepad are 

guid created by application. in windows.
Linux craeted by using kernal. It not put burden on application.

At any point in time it is upper bound by no of pid. All pid running inwindows at givetime is finite. Windows part pid creation is smaller. Again reusable for windows. Again it depends on algorithm. pid recycle is very common in windows not in linux.

Rnage of gpid is very smaller in windows.
Colliion windows is very less in windows.

use where clause or like clause in 

simmilar path is there and logging of rule engine. Process rule engine, tighten rule engine, which ensure

More fine grained condition on rule engine. Better on unique condition.

API to generte guid on application request. Same guid not ctared by another it mac to many things.

One advnagete of config file on server side is managment is easy.
Osquery is confifured half of way from server and half from client side.

For snapsjot need process tree and using table processes. Process have not having guid table. Processes is not evented table.

Processes table give informatoon about point in time sanpshot.
